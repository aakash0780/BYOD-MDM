## Rollback Procedures

### Rollback Planning and Triggers

Rollback procedures provide a safety net for returning to the previous state if critical issues are encountered during or after deployment. These procedures must be thoroughly tested and readily available during go-live activities.

### Rollback Triggers

**Automatic Rollback Triggers:**
- System availability < 95% for more than 30 minutes
- Database corruption or data loss detected
- Security breach or compromise identified
- Critical functionality failure affecting > 50% of users
- Performance degradation > 300% of baseline for > 15 minutes

**Manual Rollback Triggers:**
- Business stakeholder decision to abort deployment
- Unresolvable technical issues identified
- User acceptance criteria not met
- Compliance or regulatory issues identified
- Resource constraints preventing continued operation

### Rollback Procedures

**Level 1: Configuration Rollback**

*Scope:* Minor configuration changes and policy updates  
*Duration:* 15-30 minutes  
*Impact:* Minimal service disruption  

```bash
# Rollback configuration changes
cd /opt/mdm-deployment
git checkout HEAD~1 -- headwind-mdm/.env micromdm-nanomdm/.env

# Restart services with previous configuration
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d

# Verify service health
docker-compose ps
curl -k https://mdm-server.yourdomain.com/health
```

**Level 2: Application Rollback**

*Scope:* Application version rollback  
*Duration:* 30-60 minutes  
*Impact:* Moderate service disruption  

```bash
# Stop current services
docker-compose down

# Rollback to previous container versions
docker-compose pull # Get previous tagged versions
docker-compose up -d

# Verify database compatibility
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U hmdm -d hmdm -c "SELECT version();"

# Test critical functionality
./scripts/health-check.sh
```

**Level 3: Database Rollback**

*Scope:* Database schema or data rollback  
*Duration:* 1-4 hours  
*Impact:* Significant service disruption  

```bash
# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Restore database from backup
docker-compose exec postgres pg_restore -U hmdm -d hmdm /backups/hmdm-backup-$(date -d yesterday +%Y%m%d).sql

# Verify database integrity
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U hmdm -d hmdm -c "SELECT count(*) FROM devices;"

# Restart services
docker-compose up -d

# Validate system functionality
./scripts/full-system-test.sh
```

**Level 4: Complete System Rollback**

*Scope:* Complete system restoration  
*Duration:* 4-8 hours  
*Impact:* Complete service outage  

```bash
# Document current state for investigation
docker-compose logs > rollback-logs-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).txt
docker-compose config > rollback-config-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).yml

# Stop all services
docker-compose down
docker system prune -f

# Restore from complete system backup
tar -xzf /backups/complete-system-backup-$(date -d yesterday +%Y%m%d).tar.gz -C /

# Restore database
systemctl start postgresql
pg_restore -U hmdm -d hmdm /backups/complete-db-backup-$(date -d yesterday +%Y%m%d).sql

# Restart all services
systemctl restart docker
cd /opt/mdm-deployment
docker-compose up -d

# Complete system validation
./scripts/complete-system-validation.sh
```

### Post-Rollback Procedures

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Verify system functionality and user access
2. Communicate rollback status to stakeholders
3. Document rollback reasons and lessons learned
4. Assess impact on users and business operations
5. Plan remediation and re-deployment strategy

**Investigation and Analysis:**
1. Preserve logs and configuration for root cause analysis
2. Conduct post-incident review meeting
3. Identify process improvements and preventive measures
4. Update rollback procedures based on experience
5. Plan corrective actions and timeline for re-deployment

## Emergency Procedures

### Emergency Response Framework

Emergency procedures provide structured responses to critical incidents that threaten system availability, security, or data integrity. These procedures ensure rapid response and minimize impact on business operations.

### Incident Classification

**Priority 1 (Critical): Complete System Outage**
- System completely unavailable
- Database corruption or complete failure
- Security breach with data compromise
- Network infrastructure failure

*Response Time:* Immediate (within 15 minutes)  
*Escalation:* Automatic to all team members and management  

**Priority 2 (High): Partial System Outage**
- Single platform (Android or iOS) unavailable
- Performance degradation > 300% of baseline
- Certificate expiration affecting device communication
- Backup system failure

*Response Time:* Within 1 hour  
*Escalation:* Technical team and management  

**Priority 3 (Medium): Service Degradation**
- Performance degradation 100-300% of baseline
- Non-critical feature unavailable
- Monitoring system alerts
- Capacity warnings

*Response Time:* Within 4 hours  
*Escalation:* Technical team  

### Emergency Response Procedures

**Priority 1 Emergency Response**

*Step 1: Immediate Assessment (0-15 minutes)*
```bash
# Quick system status check
docker-compose ps
systemctl status docker
ping -c 3 mdm-server.yourdomain.com
curl -k https://mdm-server.yourdomain.com/health

# Check system resources
top -bn1 | head -20
df -h
free -h

# Check recent logs
docker-compose logs --tail=50
journalctl -u docker --since "10 minutes ago"
```

*Step 2: Incident Declaration (15-30 minutes)*
```bash
# Activate incident response team
# Send emergency notification
echo "CRITICAL: MDM System Emergency - $(date)" | mail -s "EMERGENCY: MDM System Down" emergency-team@yourdomain.com

# Document incident start time
echo "Incident Start: $(date)" > /tmp/incident-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).log
echo "Initial Assessment:" >> /tmp/incident-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).log
docker-compose ps >> /tmp/incident-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).log
```

*Step 3: Emergency Recovery (30 minutes - 4 hours)*
```bash
# Attempt service restart
docker-compose restart

# If restart fails, attempt full redeployment
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d

# If still failing, initiate rollback procedures
# (See Rollback Procedures section)

# Monitor recovery progress
watch -n 30 'docker-compose ps && curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://mdm-server.yourdomain.com/health'
```

### Security Incident Response

**Security Breach Detection**
```bash
# Immediate containment
# Isolate affected systems
sudo ufw deny in
sudo ufw deny out

# Preserve evidence
cp -r /var/log/ /tmp/security-incident-logs-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)/
docker-compose logs > /tmp/security-incident-docker-logs-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).txt

# Notify security team
echo "SECURITY INCIDENT: Potential breach detected - $(date)" | mail -s "SECURITY ALERT" security@yourdomain.com
```

**Security Incident Investigation**
```bash
# Check for unauthorized access
grep -i "failed\|invalid\|unauthorized" /var/log/auth.log
docker-compose logs | grep -i "401\|403\|error\|fail"

# Check for unusual activity
netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED
ps aux | grep -v "^\[" | sort -k3 -nr | head -20

# Check file integrity
find /opt/mdm-deployment/ -type f -mtime -1 -ls
```

### Data Recovery Procedures

**Database Recovery**
```bash
# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Assess database damage
docker-compose up -d postgres
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U hmdm -d hmdm -c "SELECT version();"

# If database is corrupted, restore from backup
docker-compose exec postgres pg_restore -U hmdm -d hmdm /backups/hmdm-backup-latest.sql

# Verify data integrity
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U hmdm -d hmdm -c "SELECT count(*) FROM devices;"
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U hmdm -d hmdm -c "SELECT count(*) FROM policies;"

# Restart all services
docker-compose up -d
```

**Configuration Recovery**
```bash
# Restore configuration from backup
cd /opt/mdm-deployment
tar -xzf /backups/config-backup-latest.tar.gz

# Verify configuration integrity
docker-compose config

# Restart services with restored configuration
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```
